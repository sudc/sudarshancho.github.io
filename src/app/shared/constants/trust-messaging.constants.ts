"TripSaver Affiliate Disclosure

TripSaver participates in affiliate programs with booking platforms including Agoda, Booking.com, Expedia, and others. When you book through our recommended links, we may earn a small commission at no additional cost to you.

Important Commitments:

1. NO INFLUENCE ON SCORES
   All destination scores, trip readiness assessments, and rankings are generated using transparent, rule-based algorithms. Affiliate partnerships do not affect:
   • Destination rankings
   • Trip readiness scores
   • Preparation guidance
   • Platform recommendations

2. TRANSPARENT METHODOLOGY
   Every score shows its breakdown. Every recommendation explains its reasoning. All data sources are attributed and publicly accessible.

3. YOUR NEEDS FIRST
   Platform recommendations are based solely on your requirements (flexibility, group size, cancellation needs) — not commission rates.

4. WHAT WE EARN
   Typical commission ranges: 2-5% of booking value. This helps us keep TripSaver free while maintaining our transparency standards.
